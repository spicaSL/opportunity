          We match creatives with community-based Census outreach efforts to generate innovative content that addresses challenges for the 2020 Census specific to hard-to-count communities.

        <div class="accelerate-subtitle">
          Led by the U.S. Census Bureau, <strong>Accelerate</strong> is an open, grassroots call for content, complementing its official campaign with the works of outside designers, content strategists, storytellers, filmmakers and others. The program works through content development sprints, partnerships, and events to bring together creatives, technologists, civic leaders and community organizers to ensure everyone in our country, regardless of location, income, race or ethnicity, is represented in the 2020 Census.

          What is the Decennial Census?
        </div>
        <div class="accelerate-text">
          <p>
            The Decennial Census is a Constitutionally-mandated count of every person living in the United States, once each decade. This population count is used to determine apportionment (the number of seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives) and how to distribute over $675 billion of annual federal funds to states, cities, and local communities for critical infrastructure and services such as housing, highways, schools, hospitals, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next Decennial Census, which begins in the Spring of 2020, every U.S. resident will be able to complete the Census online. (Phone and mail options are also available. If a household does not respond, an enumerator will take the Census at their doorstep.)  This Census will count an increasingly diverse and growing population of about 330 million people in more than 140 million housing units, presenting new challenges.

          Challenges to a complete and accurate count
        </div>
        <div class="accelerate-text">
          <p>
            Historically, certain groups have been undercounted at disproportionately high rates, including millennials, rural communities, families with young children, immigrants, non-native English speakers, renters, underrepresented minorities, and people experiencing homelessness - <strong>these are called "hard-to-count" communities.</strong> If these groups aren't counted, their communities may not receive their fair share of countless services, resources, and representation. It also impacts the data upon which countless policy, legal, and business decisions are made.

            Children may be our future, but young ones are historically undercounted. Two million children under the age of five were missed in the 2010 Census, and this has dire implications for the programs and services that they need to thrive. The sprint in New York will focus on creating content for parents, caregivers, and families of children under 5 to ensure that all people — even tiny ones — receive the funding and services that benefit them.
