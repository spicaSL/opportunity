        <div class="accelerate-title">
          Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) is a nimble, startup-like team within the U.S. Census Bureau with a portfolio of projects that are setting a standard for open innovation across government.
        </div>
        <div class="accelerate-text usa-width-three-fourths">
          <p>COIL leverages the networks, talents, and expertise of companies, organizations, and individuals
            outside our own walls to deliver on two key objectives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>increasing American prosperity by disseminating federal open data, and</li>
            <li>increasing response rates for the 2020 Census, particularly among communities
              considered <strong>"hard to count"</strong> - those historically yielding low response rates.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>COIL's open innovation strategies include ideation workshops, user-centered design, user experience
          research, technology development sprints, prize competitions, crowdsourcing, and creative partnerships.
          These initiatives solve major national problems by engaging a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders from
          the tech, media, and entertainment industries; federal, state and local government; nonprofit organizations,
          advocates, local communities, and more.</p></div>

              serve families, local leaders, and businesses and communities at large. To date, 80 products have been
